# Proces Scheduler in Operating System

In an operating system, a process scheduler is responsible for managing and prioritizing processes that are competing for CPU time. A process scheduler can be thought of as a traffic cop, determining which process should execute next, and for how long.

The scheduler employs different scheduling algorithms to determine the order in which processes are executed. The choice of scheduling algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the system and the goals of the scheduler. Some of the most common scheduling algorithms include:

    
 - Round Robin (RR):
Round Robin is a popular scheduling algorithm in which each process is given a fixed time slice called a quantum. When a process is selected for execution, it runs for a certain amount of time until its time quantum expires. If the process does not finish execution within its time slice, it is suspended, and the next process in the queue is selected for execution. This algorithm provides fair sharing of CPU resources among processes and ensures that no process is starved for CPU time.

 - Priority-Based Scheduling:
Priority-Based Scheduling is an algorithm that prioritizes processes based on their priority level. Each process is assigned a priority value, and the scheduler selects the process with the highest priority for execution. This algorithm is useful in situations where some processes require immediate attention, such as real-time applications or critical system processes.

 - Shortest Job First (SJF):
Shortest Job First is a scheduling algorithm that prioritizes processes based on their expected execution time. The process with the shortest expected execution time is selected first, and the scheduler continues to select the shortest job until all jobs are completed. This algorithm provides optimal average waiting time for processes and is useful for systems where there is a mix of long and short jobs.

 - Multiple Queues:
Multiple Queues is a scheduling algorithm that organizes processes into several different queues based on their priority level. Each queue is assigned a different priority level, and processes are assigned to the queue based on their priority. Processes in the highest priority queue are executed first, followed by processes in the next highest priority queue, and so on. This algorithm is useful for systems where there is a wide range of priorities among processes.

 - Guaranteed Scheduling:
Guaranteed Scheduling is a scheduling algorithm that ensures that each process is guaranteed a certain amount of CPU time. This algorithm is useful for real-time applications, where each process requires a certain amount of CPU time to complete its task. The scheduler allocates a certain amount of CPU time to each process and ensures that each process gets the CPU time it needs to complete its task.
